I have been converting my Tronxy Gemini S IDEX to Klipper.  On mine I currenlty have Klipper, Klipper screen on a 3.5 screen to replace the stock, a version of klicky probe, the Voron stock z-endstop, auto-Z offset working and rigid bed mounting.  I used a lot of information from https://tronxy.fandom.com/wiki/Installing_Klipper#F446_(V10_and_V6-191121)_motherboard_Printer.cfg, for flashing and the Tronxy github with the stock Marlin for the pin numbers.  Obviously I also had to use the klicky websiites and auto Z.  I have made some STL's for the klicky and Voron bed probes.  Once I finish some clean up and test the newest genoration I will add them here and Thingiverse.  I am no expert, but feel free to contact me and I can try to help.  Once I have time I will try to make this look better as well.
